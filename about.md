	Hi this is saurabh, basically a programmer intrested in deep learning, high perfomance computing, low level ridiculously fast implementations. I have decent experience in writing high perfomance code. I work for a startup [MAD Street Den](//www.madstreetden.com) based out of Chennai, India. Currently my work includes building computer vision related pieces for the company. I love to collaborate with people who share a similar passion for code.
